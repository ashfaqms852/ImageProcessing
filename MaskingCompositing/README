CpSc 6040 Programming Assignment#3

This program:-
  ->reads, writes, displays image using OIIO and OpenGL concepts.
  ->handles input from keyboard.
  ->converts rgb pixel to hsv format.
  ->performs masking of the image using different methods like -
    binary, greyscale, petro vlahos and spill supression. It also
    performs masking depending on h,s and v values.
  ->composites an image supporting 4 channels over an image supporting 3 channels.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile: make all

Execute: ./alphamask didaw.jpg (for simple masking)
         ./alphamask -pv didaw.jpg (for only petro vlahos)
         ./alphamask -ss didaw.jpg (for only spill supression)
         ./alphamask -pv -ss didaw.jpg (for both petro vlahos and spill supression)

         ./composite fg.png bg.png (performs A over B or B over A depending on the number of channels A and B have.)

Optionally, you can add "filename.ext" at the end of each command if you want 
to write the displayed image.

Clean: make clean

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

After giving the simple masking command i.e. ./alphamask didaw.jpg , press :
1 for Binary Alphamasking
2 for Greyscale Alphamasking
3 for Alphamasking using h,s and v values.(Achieves the best result)

Press w/W to write the displayed image.

UP and DOWN arrow keys increases and decreases the value of k in
petro vlahos algorithm by 0.05 respectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Function Descriptions:
Written as comments for each funtion in .cpp files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

My preferred parameters for hue, saturation and value threshold are
hardcoded. No need to read parameters from some file.

My preferred test images are didaw.jpg(for alphamask program) and 
bg.png fg.png(for composite program). I have achieved best results 
with these set of images. I have used alphamasking using hsv for
getting fg.png

I have also attached the composite result(composite.png) of bg.png 
and fg.png

Alphamasking using hsv values method achieves the best results for all
the images.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Know Problem:

My hardcoded thresholds :-
->for alphamasking using hsv, they work for every image in greenscreen.zip
->for binary and greyscale alphamasking, they work for every image 
except for aduchow.jpg, dhouse.jpg and hand.jpg
