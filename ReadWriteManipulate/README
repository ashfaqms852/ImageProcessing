This program reads, writes, displays and manipulates image using OIIO and OpenGL concepts.
It also handles input from keyboard and mouse.

CpSc 6040 Programming Assignment#1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile: make
Execute: ./oiioview

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:
To just display/read a single image, specify a valid filename followed by ./oiioview
To write a file, specify two filenames after ./oiioview. First filename would be read and written to second filename.
To read multiple files, specify them in order in which you want to display after ./oiioview.
(Basic Requirement 5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Design Choices:
I have selected an unsigned char array to store my image.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Function Descriptions:

void displayImage() - Displays the image stored in pixels[]. (Basic Requirement 1)

bool readImage(std::string filename) - Reads the image. (Basic Requirement 2)

bool writeImg() - Writes(on pressing W/w) the image. (Basic Requirement 3)

void manipulateImage(char c) - Performs several manipulations on the image. For e.g. horizontal flip(on pressing F/f) , vertical flip(I/i), display only red(R/r), green(G/g) and blue(B/b) channel in the image. (Basic Requirement 4, 6040 Requirement 1,2)

void handleKey(unsigned char key , int x , int y) - Handles the input from the keyboard. (Basic Requirement 6)

void handleMouse(int button, int value, int x, int y) - Handles the input from mouse. On a mouse click, it would display (x,y) co-ordinates and rgba values. (Basic Requirement 6)

void leftRightArrowKeys(int key , int x, int y) - Navigates through specified images when user presses left or right arrow key. (6040 Requirement 4)

bool fileExists(const std::string& filename) - Checks if the given filename exists or not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Known problem:
I have implemented atleast two 6040 requirements - displaying only red, green or blue channel and flipping image vertically.
I tried to implement left right navigation for the extra credit but couldn't implement it entirely.
It works but there is some problem with display not being cleared before drawing or with raster position.
